# CSAS-Data-Challenge

The file includes two cells of code each which can be run individually

The first cell filters the data to the required columns, creates the binary variable of on base vs. not on base, and creates a faceted scatterplot for the 6 most popular pitch types
It then creates regression lines for each outcome (on base and not on base) and prints the equation for each of these linear regression lines
If the code doesn't work, please refer to the following link:

The second cell recreates the faceted scatterplot as well but includes statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation for each of the 6 pitches not on base and on base outcomes
